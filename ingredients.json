all the ingredients. For 2 servings, simply double the ingredients.\n\nTo Make Vegetarian Dashi (Kombu + Shiitake)\n\nSoak the kombu and dried shiitake mushroom in  cup water for at least 30 minutes. Transfer the liquid into a small saucepan, including kombu and shiitake mushroom. Slowly bring the liquid to a boil over low heat. This will help enhance the dashi flavor.\n\nRight before the liquid turns into a full boil, remove the kombu and shiitake mushroom from the dashi. If you leave the kombu in the liquid, the dashi will become slimy. Turn off the heat and set aside.\n\nTo Make Soup\n\nGrind sesame seeds until they are crushed (I use this Japanese ceramic mortar and wooden pestle).\n\nPress 2 cloves of garlic and mince  inch ginger.\n\nSeparate green and white parts of scallion, and then cut into thin rounds.\n\nAdd 2 tsp sesame oil into a small saucepan. Add garlic, ginger, and white part of scallion and cook over medium-low heat until fragrant.\n\nAdd 2 tsp Spicy Bean Paste and 2 tsp miso in the saucepan. Stir constantly so that they dont burn.\n\nAdd 1 Tbsp sake. This will help you release the bits of the sauce attached to the bottom of the saucepan with a wooden spatula.\n\nAdd the ground sesame seeds and soy sauce.\n\nGradually add 1 cup soymilk, stirring constantly and making sure to dissolve Spicy Bean Paste and miso. Then add  cup kombu & shiitake dashi.\n\nAdd a dash of white peppers and salt to taste. Turn off the heat and set aside.\n\nTo Assemble\n\nOnce the soup and all the toppings are prepared, cook the fresh or dried ramen noodles in boiling water. Cook the noodles according to the package instructions (Do not overcook the noodles; I usually cook 30-60 seconds less). Make sure to loosen the noodles before adding to the water and stir the noodles so that they dont stick to each other. Reheat the ramen soup at the same time.\n\nOnce the noodles are cooked, drain the noodles very well and transfer to a ramen bowl. Pour the hot ramen soup into the bowl.\n\nPlace the toppings of your choice on ramen and enjoy!","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Gather all the ingredients.
